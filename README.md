## Concept
I would like to devlop the applicaton that can detect various types of sushi and calculate all those price.
So, employees don't need to think what kind of sushi that customer took. 
Moreover, new employees don't need to remember how many type of sushi what we're selling, what price are they.

## How it's work?

## Setup
This the how to setup your phone position
- The phone need to be over the object(sushi) at least all of sushi needs to fit in the frame
- The sushi detection will able to define by top's of sushi, not side of sushi. 
- when you take photo, it's should look like this
